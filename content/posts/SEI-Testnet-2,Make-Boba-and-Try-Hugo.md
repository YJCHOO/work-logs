## SEI Testnet 2

I spent some time completing the SEI Testnet 2 and hope to get a chunk of reward. If you are interested, here is the [guide](https://mirror.xyz/exploring.eth/BE-mz_pPAlb3xrHAV4gCGnGfJ2D7KQ8J99uauX1_YUQ) written in Chinese.

## Make Boba

Making boba by yourself is not worth it. 
Take quite some time to make and cook it.
I take almost 2 hours to make the dough, cut it into smaller pieces and shape it. Spend another 20 min to cook it well. The process is very time-consuming.

So, it's better to pay someone to make bubble tea for you. 

By the way, I mix Boba with coffee.

## Try Hugo

Compared to Jekyll, Hugo is much easier. The last time, [I tried Jekyll](https://juanstechblog.blogspot.com/2022/01/install-ruby-jekyll-use-homebrew.html). I need to download and set up a lot of things. Install Ruby, download Jekyll, Bundler, and additional Ruby Gem for the theme. Then, only able to create a site and start writing.

For Hugo, I only use Homebrew to install the Hugo. Then, I can start to create a site, select a theme and start writing. Easy and Simple.

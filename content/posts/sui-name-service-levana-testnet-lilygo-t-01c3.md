## Sui Name Service and Lenava Testnet.
Tasks from SUI Name Service and Lenava testnet are simple. You can check out these articles for [Sui Name Service](https://mirror.xyz/0x891dDE39445f54bc6f1b73e89398f96e7851B4ba/J3JH-FDuvX479qIrInDIA8XCH-2xZhHfd7BzFDHT-BU) and [Lenava](https://mirror.xyz/0x891dDE39445f54bc6f1b73e89398f96e7851B4ba/qbL0JUjf6rAKWN3BSJBineu1fJX7Lx7dxdxPeJMXjn0) testnet guide written in Chinese to complete them. 

## Data Entry work.
I planned to complete the data entry work by the end of the day, but my procrastination kicked in. So, I only did 20% of the work.

## LILYGO T-01C3
I finally bought LILYGO T-01C3. 

I plan to make a sensor for my bathroom to detect motion and door status to control the light switch based on some logic. But, I can't find any suitable microcontroller/NodeMCU in Malaysia. Most of them are power-hungry and unable to run on a 2(maybe 3 for Ni-MH rechargeable battery) AA battery for a few months. Also, I don't have the skill to modify all the boards to fit my needs. My soldering skill is really bad.

I saw [LILYGO T-01C3 GitHub](https://github.com/Xinyuan-LilyGO/T-01C3) show that this board can turn into deep sleep mode in the program and draw very little power(5.33uA according to the GitHub repository). So, it looks like the best choice. 

My problem with it's the price. A china seller from Shopee sells it for around RM 22 inlcuded shipping. LILYGO T-01C3 considers the ESP-01 successor. Also, double up the price. I used a Shopee voucher and got it for RM 16.1. Still expensive but acceptable.

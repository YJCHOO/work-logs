## Nomic Testnet 2
I miss out on the first [Nomic stakedrop](https://blog.nomic.io/nomic-stakenet-launch). My ATOM stake doesn't meet the minimum 1.5 ATOM stake requirement. For [Nomic's second Airdrop](https://cosmospug.com/nomic-airdrop/), I think I will meet the requirement to stake outside the top 20 validators on EVMOS, JUNO, OSMO, KUJI, and ATOM.

Also, [Nomic is doing testnet](https://twitter.com/StakeandRelax/status/1578519330622693376?s=20&t=c53jaatl6cJe1SI2QbwatA). So, I spent some time and completed all the easy tasks. It looks like not a big testnet incentive, but better than nothing.

## Motion Sensor(PIR) Go Wrong.
I got my LILYGO T-01C3. I play it around with a magnetic contact switch sensor and PIR. The magnetic reed sensor works well, but the PIR sensor can't get any signal. I still try to debug it. 

I still not yet play the deep sleep function on the LILYGO T-01C3.

## Data Entry
Yup. Keep entry data.
